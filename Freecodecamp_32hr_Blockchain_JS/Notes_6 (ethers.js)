Ethers.js is a library to interact with Ethereum and its environment.
yarn add ethers  //to install ether in wsl environment

The require() statement is used to add the ethers library. It works similar to the import() except for some differences.

The Blockchain providers provide nodes on blockchain for our projects. They help us connect with the blockchain and mnanage our nodes too.

yarn add fs-extra : to install package fs to read from files
import using require() statement.

One Block Confirmation : Confirmation is the time elapsed between a blockchain transaction is submitted to a network and the time it is fully confirmed into a 
                         block. One Block Confirmation means the transaction is fully confirmed to a block only when another block is confirmed on top of it.
                         That is, the txn is submitted, a block is confirmed on top of it, then the txn is confirmed as a block.
